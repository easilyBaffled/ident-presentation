## Why are any of use here?

####

`To fix what ain’t broke!`

```notes Intro.2
I have been batting around an idea for awhile. And I wanted to pass it on to all of you for a review.
Because it's made my life alot easier, and is almost nothing.
On an almost daily basis, when I need to do a little debbugging I end up writing this...
```

---

```js
console.ident = v => (console.log(v), v);
```

```notes ident.1
First, yes I am attatching to the global console object. I'm a mad man.
Second, the parens ...
```

---

## Identity Function

```js
v => v;
```

```notes ident.2
I'm taking advantage of a concept called the identiy funciton. With this signature. Thing in, Thing out.
What the signature doesn't revleal is all of the affects that happen between the arrow.
If that seems odd to you now, that's perfectly resonable, it's about to make sense
```

Javascript has become an Expressive language

```notes problem.1
Starting with ES6 (salvation of the browser) Javascript has become a more Expressive language
```

---

export default Columns.two;

`Async`

```js
Promise;
```

`Iterate`

```js
map;
```

`Conditional`

```js
bool ? a : b;
```

`Function`

```js
v => v;
```

```notes problem.2
By which I mean it has become filled with expression.
expressions are things that result in a value. So you can pass them into a funciton without issue
...This is not a problem, I'm a fan, but it has sparked my problem
```

---

#### We’ve moved from Statements to Expressions

---

export default Columns.three;

`Async`

```js
Promise;
```

```js
callbacks;
```

`Iterate`

```js
map;
```

```js
for( var ... )
```

`Conditional`

```js
bool ? a : b;
```

```js
if ( bool ) ...
else ...
```

`Function`

```js
v => v;
```

```js
function ( v ) {
    return v
}
```

```notes problem.3
And JS is filled with them, almost every Statement has an Expresive counterpart,
```

---

### Almost

```notes problem.4
...almost
```

---

There is no `Expression` console function<Emphasis>\*</Emphasis>

```notes problem.5
MDN has 21 console functions. One outputs a table. One lets you measure performance. Log lets you use css to style the output.
But they all return `undefined` - so I lied, they are expressions, just really dumb expressions
Which makes debbuging just that much harder, not harder but cumbersome
```

    fetch(userBaseData)
        .then( ( { userId } ) => fetchUserAccounts( userId ))
        .then( console.ident )
        .then( formatCurrencies )

```notes problem.6

```

---

    - ternary
    Number(val) ? formatCurrency(str) : val

```notes problem.7

```

---

    - Object creation with ternary
    ```js
    ( acc, val ) => ( {
        ...acc,
        amount: Number(val) ? formatCurrency(str) : val
    } )
    ```

```notes problem.8

```

---

```js
v => v;
```

```notes solution.1
Back to where we started, a function that takes in a thing and returns a thing.
To the thing calling it, nothing happens
```

---

```js
console.ident = v => (console.log(v), v);
```

```notes solution.2
console.ident is the missing logging function that we need in modern JS
```

---

    - for loop

```notes solution.3

```

---

    - ternary

```notes solution.4

```

    - Object creation with ternary
