## Why are any of us here?

### `To fix what ain't broke!`

<Notes>
    I started right before the introduction of Babel. So I got to see the Javascript that was, the Promise of ES6 and well, now.
    Recently I set out to fix a pin-prick of a problem that arose as a result of ES6 and modern javascript.
</Notes>

---
<Grid>
    <Js>{objectStart}</Js>
</Grid>
<Notes>
    Because THIS, while perhaps a little daunting, is what modern JS has given us.
    Very concise, very deliberate code.
    I am able to pull out exactly what I need from the variables, without a name for variables.
    I can create and return object without the word `return`
    I have a flattened ternaries instead of an if block, and so on and so forth.
    I like it, I like it sparse it is. How condensed it is compared to what it would have been a few years ago.
    But there's a problem, past style preference, past the fact that if you pass a string "0" into number it will eval to false.

    The function is so concise, there's no room for a `console.log`.
    The moment something goes wrong, ...and it will. The moment I need to log anything in here ...and I will,
    I have to essentially explode this function.
</Notes>

---
<Grid>
    <Js>{objectLog}</Js>
</Grid>
<Notes>
    And it's not pretty.
    Again, a pin-prick of a problem, but it's enough to ruin a good train of thought.
    I wrote this function to really hammer home the issue, perhaps it's bit much.
</Notes>
---

<Grid>
    <Js>{chainLog}</Js>
</Grid>

<Notes>
    This might be a bit more common
    Chaining a bunch of array functions together. One of the hallmarks of ES6.
    And it has the same issue. There's no room to fit a `console.log`

    And that's because `console.log` is one of the last things in Javascript that hasn't been modernized.
    It's a remnant of a time when Javascript was consider to be one of the worse languages, whereas now it's one of the most popular.

### Javascript has become
### an <span style={{color: '#0af'}}>Expressive</span> language

<Notes>
    Javascript has become a more Expressive language. By which I mean it has become filled with expression.
    You could go your whole career without hearing about Expressions.
    But they are one of the two building blocks of javascript.
    Expressions are things that result in a value.
</Notes>

<Columns.two enableBorder={true}>

**BinaryExpression**

`1+1`

**AssignmentExpression**

`x = 1 + 1`

**ArrayExpression**

`[1, 2]`

**CallExpression**

`[1, 2].map( v => v + 1 )`

**CallExpression**

```js
[1, 2]
    .map( v => v + 1 )
    .filter( v => v % 2 )
```

</Columns.two>

<Notes>
    Essentially Expressions are things that you could pass into a function without issue.
    The other half of Javascript are called Statements.
    Statements, are things there trying to cram them into a function call would throw an error.
    Like the for loop, or if statement. Blocks essentially.
    You count on effects and

Iterate

There is no `Expression` console function.

<Image width="50vw" height="30vh" src="chrome-console.png"/>

<Notes>
That's a bit of a lie.
MDN as 21 different console functions and they all returned `undefined`.
So they are expressions, they're just dumb expressions ( like `Array.prototype.push` ).
Which makes debugging logging cumbersome.
My formatter function suffered from that

<Grid>
    <Js>
        {tapDefinition}
    </Js>
</Grid>
<Notes>
I've created `console.tap` is the missing logging function that we need in modern JS.
First, yes I'm adding it to the global console object, I'm a mad man
Second this function works with a very simple rule. 1 Value. It takes 1 value, logs that value, and returns that value.
To the calling function, and the context around it, nothing happens. Which means there is no extra overhead or setup to debugging.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/console.tap.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/console.tap/)

<Notes>
    It's such a simple function that I'm surprised or suspicious that no one else has popularized it.
    (...unless you look at the ramda docs)
    I think it belongs in the spec for Javascript, but it needs more than just me playing with it.
    So I encourage you all to try it out.
    I have a module( [console.tap]( https://github.com/easilyBaffled/console.tap ) ) out there that solves a few issues of it not being .
    And it also lets you choose between adding it to the global object or using as it's own function.
    But it's 26 characters I encourage you to play with the idea and use the module as a place to discuss it.
